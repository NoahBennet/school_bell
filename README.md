# school_bell
This little script is a tool for teachers currently doing home office with a user friendly gui (Excel file). One can define exactly when a bell should be ringing.

The file needs to be put in the same directory with school_bell_sound.mp3 and skolske zvonenie.xlsx.
The school_bell_sound.mp3 can be changed to any other mp3, but the melody shouldn't be longer than 59 seconds.
