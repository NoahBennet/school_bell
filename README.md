# school_bell
This little script is a tool for teachers currently doing home office with a user friendly gui (Excel file). One can define exactly when a bell should be ringing.

The file needs to be put in the same directory with school_bell_sound.mp3 and skolske zvonenie.xlsx.
The school_bell_sound.mp3 can be changed to any other mp3, but the melody shouldn't be longer than 59 seconds.

With the .bat file you can automatically make an .exe from the program, just double click it. Get that exe and the .mp3 and .xlsx file and give it to any friend!
